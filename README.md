# PB95-Datamining 
Datamining is done through comparing the `main.lua` files contained in the `resources.car` file.

Keep in mind that builds are decompiled by hand using a script ([Check out this folder for more info](https://github.com/Progressbar-Discord-Server/PB95-Datamining/tree/main/decompiling)).

**It is currently impossible to recompile the game from the source code. In addition, it's also obfuscated.**
